    "description": "Learn English with fun videos!\n\nLearning English is VOA’s multimedia source of news and information for millions of English learners worldwide.\n\nLearning English began as Special English, which Voice of America launched in 1959. Special English newscasts and features were a primary fixture of VOA’s international shortwave broadcasts for more than half a century. In 2014, our line of products was expanded to include more English teaching materials, and the service became known as Learning English.\n\nLearners absorb American English through content drawn from U.S. and world news, Health and Lifestyle, Science and Technology, Arts and Culture, and other topics. Learners can build vocabulary, strengthen speaking skills and improve the ability to communicate for work, school and everyday life.\n\nAudio programs and captioned videos - English in A Minute, Everyday Grammar TV and Learning English TV - are written using vocabulary at the upper-beginner and intermediate level. \n\n\n",
